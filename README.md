# Game Database - Laravel
This project is made for learning purposes, as a task of a subject about Laravel of my graduation course.

## What does it do
This is meant to be a database to store data about digital games: Genders, distribution licenses, developer organization (and its parent organizations), release year, game engine (and its developer organization, licenses, etc), technologies used in the development, etc.

The purpose of storing all its data is to make it available via a REST (maybe GraphQL, I need to get more into this) API to be used in another project of mine.
